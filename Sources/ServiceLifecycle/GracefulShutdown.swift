import ConcurrencyHelpers

/// Execute an operation with a graceful shutdown handler that’s immediately invoked if the current task is shutting down gracefully.
///
/// This doesn’t check for graceful shutdown, and always executes the passed operation.
/// The operation executes on the calling execution context and does not suspend by itself, unless the code contained within the closure does.
/// If graceful shutdown occurs while the operation is running, the graceful shutdown handler will execute concurrently with the operation.
///
/// When `withGracefulShutdownHandler` is used in a Task that has already been gracefully shutdown, the `onGracefulShutdown` handler
/// will be executed immediately before operation gets to execute. This allows the `onGracefulShutdown` handler to set some external “shutdown” flag
/// that the operation may be atomically checking for in order to avoid performing any actual work once the operation gets to run.
///
/// A common use-case is to listen to graceful shutdown and use the `ServerQuiescingHelper` from `swift-nio-extras` to
/// trigger the quiescing sequence. Furthermore, graceful shutdown will propagate to any child task that is currently executing
///
/// - Important: This method will only set up a handler if run inside ``ServiceGroup`` otherwise no graceful shutdown handler
/// will be set up.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - operation: The actual operation.
///   - handler: The handler which is invoked once graceful shutdown has been triggered.
// Unsafely inheriting the executor is safe to do here since we are not calling any other async method
// except the operation. This makes sure no other executor hops would occur here.
